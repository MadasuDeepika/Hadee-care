This is an app developed to help women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 



Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a medical condition which causes hormonal disorder in women in their childbearing years. The hormonal imbalance leads to a delayed or even absent menstrual cycle. Women with PCOS majorly suffer from excessive weight gain, facial hair growth, acne, hair loss, skin darkening and irregular periods leading to infertility in rare cases. The existing methodologies and treatments are insufficient for early-stage detection and prediction. 


To deal with this problem, we propose a system which can help in early detection and prediction of PCOS treatment from an optimal and minimal set of parameters.
